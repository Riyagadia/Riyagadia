### About Me
I'm Riya Gadia, an engineer with a background in Electronics and Communication Engineering, which I completed in 2017. As a fresh graduate, I am passionate about transitioning into the field of data science.

### Professional Background

During my time in college, I worked on various projects that honed my technical skills. Some of the key projects include:
- **Line Follower:** Developed a robot that can follow a line using sensor inputs and control algorithms.
- **Data Transmission Through Light:** Implemented a system to transmit data using visible light communication (Li-Fi).

### Transition to Data Science

My interest in data science began with the realization of the vast potential of data-driven decision making. To transition into this field, I have been actively learning through online courses, self-study, and hands-on projects. I am particularly interested in machine learning, data analysis, and visualization.

### Skills and Tools

- **Engineering Skills:** circuit design, signal processing
- **Data Science Skills:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), Data Analysis, Machine Learning (beginner)
- **Tools and Technologies:** Arduino, Jupyter Notebook

### Projects and Contributions

I am currently working on building my portfolio with data science projects, which I will be sharing on my GitHub soon. Stay tuned for updates!

### Future Goals

I aim to specialize in data analysis and machine learning, contributing to projects that leverage data to solve real-world problems. I am eager to collaborate with others in the data science community and continuously improve my skills.
